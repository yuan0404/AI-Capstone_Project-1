The Ameca is an autonomous humanoid robot developed by the University of Oxford's Robot Endurance Laboratory, in collaboration with the Oxford Robotics Institute. Designed to mimic human-like appearance and movement, the robot was created using advanced machine learning algorithms and artificial intelligence techniques. Initially unveiled in 2018, the Ameca has undergone significant improvements through continuous software updates and hardware enhancements, allowing it to exhibit increasingly sophisticated behaviors and interactions.
