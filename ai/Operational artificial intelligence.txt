Operational artificial intelligence refers to the deployment and utilization of artificial intelligence (AI) systems within operational environments, such as business processes, manufacturing systems, or military operations. The primary goal of operational AI is to enhance efficiency, productivity, and decision-making capabilities by leveraging advanced algorithms and machine learning techniques. By integrating AI into existing workflows and infrastructure, organizations can automate tasks, predict patterns, and respond to changing conditions in real-time, thereby optimizing performance and competitiveness.

Operational AI encompasses a broad range of applications, including predictive maintenance, supply chain optimization, and autonomous systems for logistics and transportation. The technology has also been adopted in various industries, such as healthcare, finance, and education, where it is used to analyze vast amounts of data, identify trends, and provide insights that inform business strategy.

The development and implementation of operational AI involve significant technical, social, and economic considerations. As AI systems become increasingly pervasive in organizational settings, issues related to accountability, trust, and bias have emerged as pressing concerns. Furthermore, the deployment of operational AI raises questions about the role of human workers, the need for continuous skill development, and the potential risks and unintended consequences associated with relying on automated decision-making systems.

This article aims to provide an overview of the concepts, challenges, and applications of operational artificial intelligence, drawing on existing research and expertise in the field.
