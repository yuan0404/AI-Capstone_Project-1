Neuro-symbolic AI refers to a subfield of artificial intelligence that integrates concepts from both neuroscience and symbolic reasoning. This approach seeks to bridge the gap between the cognitive processes of humans, which are grounded in symbolic representations of knowledge and experience, and the computational models of traditional machine learning algorithms.

At its core, neurosymbolic AI leverages insights from the structure and function of the human brain, including the neural networks that underlie perception, attention, memory, and decision-making. By drawing upon these naturalistic inspirations, researchers aim to develop more robust and flexible artificial intelligence systems capable of handling complex tasks that require a deep understanding of symbolic representations and their interactions.

Neurosymbolic AI has garnered significant attention in recent years due to its potential to enable the development of more general-purpose intelligent machines, capable of reasoning, learning, and problem-solving across multiple domains. This approach has also been explored in various applications, including natural language processing, computer vision, and robotics, where it has shown promise in addressing challenges related to knowledge representation, inference, and integration.
