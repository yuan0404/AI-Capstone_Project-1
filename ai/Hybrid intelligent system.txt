A hybrid intelligent system is a complex information processing framework that integrates multiple intelligent technologies to achieve enhanced problem-solving capabilities. This approach combines various subfields of artificial intelligence (AI), including machine learning, expert systems, optimization algorithms, and other specialized techniques, to create a comprehensive system capable of tackling intricate problems in diverse domains.

The underlying concept of hybrid intelligent systems is rooted in the recognition that individual AI components often struggle with complex, real-world challenges due to limitations in data quality, scalability, or interpretability. By bridging these gaps through integration and fusion of multiple AI approaches, hybrid systems aim to develop novel problem-solving strategies that can address the complexities of modern systems.

Hybrid intelligent systems have attracted significant interest across academia and industry due to their potential for improving performance, efficiency, and adaptability in various applications, including but not limited to decision-making, pattern recognition, process optimization, and more.
