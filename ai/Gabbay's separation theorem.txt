Gabbay's Separation Theorem is a significant result in mathematical logic, developed by Amnon Gabbay. It represents a pivotal contribution to the field of modal logic, providing a novel approach to understanding the relationships between different logical systems.

The theorem was first introduced by Gabbay in 2005 as part of his work on non-classical logics and their applications. By establishing a systematic way to compare and contrast various modal logics, Gabbay's Separation Theorem has had far-reaching implications for research in logic, philosophy, and computer science.

The theorem is characterized by its focus on the distinction between different types of modal logics, including those with non-standard truth values, paraconsistent logics, and many-valued logics. Through a rigorous analysis of these systems, Gabbay's work offers a comprehensive understanding of their properties, relationships, and applications in various domains.

Gabbay's Separation Theorem has been influential in the development of new approaches to logical reasoning, modal model theory, and the study of non-standard mathematical structures. It continues to be an active area of research, with ongoing efforts to refine and expand its application in fields such as artificial intelligence, formal verification, and philosophical logic.
