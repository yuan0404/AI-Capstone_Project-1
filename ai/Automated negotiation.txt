Automated negotiation refers to the use of computational algorithms and artificial intelligence techniques to facilitate negotiations between parties, with the aim of achieving mutually beneficial outcomes. This approach leverages the principles of game theory, economics, and machine learning to analyze and optimize negotiation strategies, often in real-time. By employing automated systems, negotiators can potentially improve efficiency, reduce uncertainty, and increase the quality of agreements reached.

The concept of automated negotiation has evolved significantly over the past two decades, with advancements in natural language processing, optimization techniques, and data analytics enabling more sophisticated and effective applications. As a result, various industries, including business, politics, and education, are exploring the potential benefits of automated negotiation for improving decision-making processes and resolving complex conflicts.

Key aspects of automated negotiation include the development of specialized software tools, the application of machine learning algorithms to analyze negotiation patterns, and the integration of human intuition and expertise with computational models. The use of automated negotiation systems has also raised important questions regarding fairness, transparency, and accountability in negotiations, as well as concerns about the potential for bias and unequal power dynamics.

This article aims to provide an overview of the current state of knowledge on automated negotiation, highlighting its key concepts, applications, benefits, and challenges.
