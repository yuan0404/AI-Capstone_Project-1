Mode collapse refers to a phenomenon observed in social media platforms, where the collective expression and identity of a community or subculture are compressed into a singular, dominant aesthetic or set of behaviors, resulting in the homogenization of individuality and diversity within that group. This concept has gained significant attention in recent years as an important aspect of online culture, particularly in the context of social media, influencer marketing, and consumer behavior.
