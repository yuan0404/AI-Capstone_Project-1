Character computing refers to the processing and manipulation of data using alphanumeric characters as the primary means of representation. This approach was widely used in early computing systems, particularly in mainframe and minicomputers, where the cost and complexity of physical storage devices limited the use of graphical displays. Character computing relied on keyboards, terminals, and character-based input/output (I/O) interfaces to interact with computers.

The development of character computing dates back to the mid-20th century, when the first electronic computers were being built. The first commercially available computer, UNIVAC I, used a keyboard and display system that relied on alphanumeric characters to represent data. This approach allowed for efficient use of resources and facilitated the creation of specialized applications, such as text editors, compilers, and operating systems.

Character computing played a significant role in shaping the early history of computing, influencing the design of early programming languages, software development tools, and user interfaces. Despite its limitations, character computing provided a robust and reliable means of interacting with computers, paving the way for the widespread adoption of graphical user interfaces (GUIs) in modern computing systems.
