The Wumpus World is a classic domain used to study decision-making under uncertainty, originating from the game of Hunt the Wumpus. It is typically described as an 18x15 grid with two entrances, one exit, and various obstacles such as pits, dead ends, and a monster (the Wumpus) that roams randomly within the grid.

The environment is characterized by a set of rules governing its behavior: each cell can be either empty or contain one of three types of objects - air, water, or pit. The Wumpus moves according to certain probabilistic laws, allowing for an analysis of the game's dynamics and decision-making strategies.
