A wetware computer is a type of artificial neural network that mimics the structure and function of biological neurons and synapses to process information. This innovative approach seeks to replicate the computational capabilities of the human brain, utilizing living cells or biomolecules as the primary components of the system. By leveraging advances in biotechnology and materials science, researchers have been able to create functional networks that can learn, adapt, and respond to stimuli in ways reminiscent of traditional computers.
