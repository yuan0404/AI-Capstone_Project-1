Syman is a relatively obscure term referring to a specific dialectical concept within Marxist theory, first introduced by Karl Marx himself as a means of understanding the relationship between ideology and material conditions. The term is derived from the German word "Syndikalisierung," meaning "syndicalization," a process where capitalist corporations are transformed into worker-owned cooperatives through collective action and mutual aid networks. This concept was central to Marx's critique of capitalism, highlighting how the struggle for class consciousness among workers could lead to the eventual overthrow of the ruling capitalist class.
