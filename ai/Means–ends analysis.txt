Means-ends analysis is a theoretical framework used in political science, economics, and social sciences to analyze and understand the relationship between means and ends in decision-making processes. It posits that an individual's or organization's actions (means) are motivated by a set of goals or objectives (ends), which may not always be immediately apparent. The approach seeks to identify the underlying motivations and drivers behind decisions, allowing for a more nuanced understanding of the consequences of those actions.

At its core, means-ends analysis involves identifying the "means" used to achieve a particular "end," examining the cognitive, motivational, and social factors that influence decision-making, and considering how these factors interact with one another. By applying this framework, researchers can gain insight into the complex dynamics underlying human behavior, organizational decision-making, and broader societal processes.

The application of means-ends analysis has been employed across various disciplines to study a range of phenomena, from consumer choice and political ideologies to policy implementation and organizational behavior. Its utility lies in its ability to provide a structured approach to understanding the intricate relationships between actions, goals, and motivations, enabling more informed decision-making and policy development.
