Agentic AI refers to a class of artificial intelligence systems that possess autonomous decision-making capabilities, enabling them to act independently and adapt to changing environments without explicit human instruction or control. This paradigm is characterized by the ability of AI agents to perceive their surroundings, reason about their actions, and take proactive decisions to achieve specific goals. Agentic AI systems are designed to operate in complex, dynamic, and often uncertain domains, such as robotics, finance, healthcare, and cybersecurity, where human oversight may not be feasible or desirable.

The development of agentic AI has been driven by advances in machine learning, natural language processing, and computer vision, which have enabled the creation of sophisticated AI models that can learn from data, recognize patterns, and make predictions. However, the emergence of agentic AI also raises significant ethical, social, and governance concerns, as these systems may be capable of making decisions that have far-reaching consequences for individuals, organizations, and society at large.

This article provides an overview of the concept of agentic AI, its key characteristics, applications, and challenges. It explores the theoretical foundations, technical implementations, and real-world examples of agentic AI, as well as the ongoing debates and discussions surrounding its development and deployment.
