An intelligent database is a computer-based repository that combines advanced data management capabilities with sophisticated reasoning and decision-making algorithms, enabling it to automatically process, analyze, and derive insights from large datasets. These databases employ machine learning and artificial intelligence techniques to learn patterns and relationships within the data, automate tasks, and provide real-time recommendations. By integrating human expertise and automated processing, intelligent databases aim to increase efficiency, accuracy, and productivity in various domains, such as business, healthcare, finance, and science.
