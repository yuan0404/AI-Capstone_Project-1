A histogram of oriented displacements is a mathematical technique used to quantify and analyze the distribution of directions and magnitudes of movements or displacements within an image. This method is commonly employed in computer vision applications, such as object tracking, motion segmentation, and gesture recognition. The histogram provides a visual representation of the directionality and magnitude of displacements, allowing for the identification of dominant movement patterns, orientation biases, and spatial relationships between objects.

The technique was first introduced by Carl R. Shah and Eric P. Hall in 1999, as an extension to traditional Histograms of Oriented Gradients (HOG). The original HOG approach was designed to detect and describe local features within images, but the histogram of oriented displacements further extends this concept by incorporating spatial information about movement patterns.
