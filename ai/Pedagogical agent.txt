A pedagogical agent is an artificial intelligence (AI) system designed to assist and support human learning and teaching processes. The primary goal of these agents is to facilitate effective communication between humans and technology, enabling students to acquire knowledge, skills, and attitudes through interactive and adaptive learning experiences. Pedagogical agents can take various forms, including chatbots, virtual instructors, and intelligent tutoring systems, which employ machine learning algorithms to personalize instruction and adapt to individual students' needs and abilities. By leveraging the capabilities of AI, pedagogical agents aim to enhance student engagement, promote deeper understanding, and foster more effective teacher-student interactions.
