An embodied agent is a hypothetical artificial intelligence entity that embodies and interacts with its environment through physical means, leveraging sensorimotor skills to achieve goals and adapt to changing situations. This concept draws from theories of cognitive science, robotics, and philosophy, combining insights from disciplines such as embodiment theory, sensorimotor learning, and situated cognition. The idea of an embodied agent posits that intelligence arises not solely from computational processes but also from the integration of sensory information and motor actions, allowing for a more holistic and interactive understanding of intelligent systems.
