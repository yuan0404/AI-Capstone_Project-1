Extremal optimization is a class of metaheuristics used to solve complex optimization problems by iteratively improving a solution through a process of local search and adaptation. This approach differs from traditional optimization methods, which often rely on global or exact algorithms, by focusing instead on the local landscape of the problem domain. By identifying and exploiting promising regions within this landscape, extremal optimization algorithms can identify optimal or near-optimal solutions to a wide range of problems, including those with complex or non-linear objective functions.

The core idea behind extremal optimization is to iteratively update the current solution using a set of simple and intuitive rules that are designed to improve the overall fitness of the solution. These rules typically involve modifying one or more components of the current solution, such as adding or removing variables, or adjusting weights or coefficients. Through this iterative process, the algorithm aims to converge towards an optimal or near-optimal solution, often in a surprisingly short number of iterations.

Extremal optimization has been successfully applied to a diverse range of problems across various fields, including machine learning, finance, engineering, and computer science. Its simplicity, flexibility, and ease of implementation have made it a popular choice for solving complex optimization problems that are difficult or impossible to solve using traditional methods.
