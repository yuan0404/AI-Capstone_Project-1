A knowledge-based system is a computer-based information processing system that uses a knowledge base to store, manage, and apply knowledge to solve problems or make decisions. The core of a knowledge-based system lies in its ability to represent and manipulate knowledge using various formalisms such as rules, ontologies, and decision theories. This representation enables the system to reason about complex situations, recognize patterns, and make informed decisions based on the stored information.

Knowledge-based systems are designed to mimic human-like reasoning and problem-solving capabilities by utilizing a combination of natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning algorithms. These systems can be applied in various domains such as artificial intelligence, expert systems, decision support systems, and more.
