The Joint Artificial Intelligence Center is a research and development organization within the United States Department of Defense (DoD) that focuses on advancing the field of artificial intelligence (AI) to support national security objectives. The center was established in 2019 with the goal of coordinating the DoD's efforts in AI research, development, and deployment across various domains, including machine learning, computer vision, natural language processing, and robotics.

Located at the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA), the Joint Artificial Intelligence Center brings together experts from various branches of the military services, as well as industry partners and academia, to foster collaboration and knowledge sharing in AI research. The center's primary objective is to ensure that AI technologies are developed and integrated into DoD systems in a way that enhances capabilities while minimizing risks.

By integrating AI across the full range of DoD operations, from combat and logistics to intelligence gathering and cybersecurity, the Joint Artificial Intelligence Center aims to enhance national security by leveraging cutting-edge technology and improving decision-making processes. The center's work is guided by a set of principles that emphasize responsible innovation, transparency, and accountability in the development and deployment of AI systems.
