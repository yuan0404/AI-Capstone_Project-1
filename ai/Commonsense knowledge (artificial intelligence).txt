Commonsense knowledge is a fundamental aspect of human cognition that refers to the everyday knowledge and reasoning abilities that enable individuals to navigate their environment, interact with others, and make informed decisions in routine situations. This type of knowledge is often implicit and tacit, relying on shared experiences, social norms, and cultural backgrounds to guide decision-making.

In artificial intelligence (AI), commonsense knowledge is a crucial component of human-computer interaction, enabling machines to understand and respond to natural language input, recognize objects and events in images, and make decisions in complex, dynamic environments. The development of AI systems that can effectively integrate commonsense knowledge has become an active area of research, with applications ranging from virtual assistants and chatbots to autonomous vehicles and healthcare diagnostics.

Despite its importance, commonsense knowledge remains a challenging and understudied aspect of human cognition, requiring advances in areas such as natural language processing, cognitive psychology, and machine learning. This article provides an overview of the current state of research on commonsense knowledge, its underlying mechanisms and representations, and its applications in AI systems.
