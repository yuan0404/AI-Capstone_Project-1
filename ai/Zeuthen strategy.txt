The Zeuthen strategy is a heuristic algorithm used to determine the optimal assignment of elements from one set to another set with fewer or equal number of elements, such as job assignments to workers or color assignments for a graph. Developed by the German mathematician Wilhelm Zeuthen in 1930, this combinatorial technique has been widely applied in computer science, operations research, and logistics.

The Zeuthen strategy is based on a systematic approach that considers all possible permutations of elements from one set and assigns them to the other set in an efficient manner. It involves the use of binary strings to represent assignments, which enables the algorithm to be easily implemented and optimized for large-scale problems.

This article provides an overview of the Zeuthen strategy, including its history, mathematical formulation, and applications in various fields.
