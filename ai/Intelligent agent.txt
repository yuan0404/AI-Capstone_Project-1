An intelligent agent is a software program designed to perform a specific task or set of tasks that require intelligence, autonomy, and adaptability. The term "agent" refers to a system that can perceive its environment, reason about its state, and act upon it to achieve a desired outcome. Intelligent agents are typically characterized by their ability to learn, adapt, and improve their performance over time through interactions with their environment. They often rely on machine learning algorithms, natural language processing techniques, or other forms of artificial intelligence to enable their decision-making capabilities.

The concept of intelligent agents has been explored in various fields, including computer science, artificial intelligence, robotics, and cybersecurity. These systems can be used to simulate human-like behavior, automate complex tasks, and interact with humans in a more intuitive and natural way. Intelligent agents have numerous applications across industries, such as customer service chatbots, autonomous vehicles, and expert systems for decision-making.

This article provides an overview of the definition, characteristics, and applications of intelligent agents, as well as their current state of development and future research directions.
