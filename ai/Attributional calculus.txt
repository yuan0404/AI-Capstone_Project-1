Attributional calculus is a theoretical framework used to quantify the impact of cause-and-effect relationships on outcomes or behaviors in various domains, including psychology, economics, sociology, and philosophy. The core concept revolves around measuring the relative contribution of different factors, often referred to as causes or attributes, to explain variations in observed phenomena.

In this context, attributional calculus aims to provide a systematic and empirical approach to understanding how attributions—perceptions of cause-and-effect relationships—shape our behavior, decision-making, and attitudes. This framework can be applied across multiple disciplines, including social sciences, business, education, and healthcare, allowing researchers and practitioners to better comprehend the dynamics underlying complex phenomena.

The development of attributional calculus draws on insights from various theoretical traditions, such as attribution theory, decision-making models, and social network analysis. By integrating these perspectives, this framework offers a comprehensive tool for analyzing cause-and-effect relationships, evaluating their relative importance, and identifying potential avenues for intervention or optimization.
