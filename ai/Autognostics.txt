Autognostics refers to the field of self-observation and introspection, wherein individuals utilize their own cognitive processes and observational skills to identify patterns, make connections, and draw conclusions about their thoughts, emotions, and behaviors. This approach emphasizes personal agency, autonomy, and subjective experience, allowing individuals to develop a deeper understanding of themselves and their place within the world.

Autognostics draws upon a range of philosophical, psychological, and scientific traditions, including phenomenology, existentialism, and cognitive science. By engaging in systematic self-observation, individuals can cultivate meta-cognitive skills, refine their decision-making processes, and enhance their overall well-being. The practice of autognostics is rooted in the idea that knowledge of oneself is essential to personal growth, self-awareness, and effective action.

The concept of autognostics has been explored in various contexts, including psychology, philosophy, and education. Researchers have used this approach to study self-awareness, self-regulation, and social-emotional learning, among other topics. In practice, autognostics can be employed as a tool for personal development, therapeutic growth, and academic success.
