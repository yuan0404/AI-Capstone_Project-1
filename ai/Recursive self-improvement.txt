Recursive self-improvement refers to the hypothetical process by which an intelligent system or entity modifies its own design, architecture, or capabilities through a recursive cycle of improvement, with the ultimate goal of achieving optimal performance, efficiency, or goal attainment. This concept has been explored in various fields, including artificial intelligence, cognitive science, and philosophy, as a means of understanding the potential for self-improvement and the limits of intelligent system development.

The idea of recursive self-improvement is based on the notion that an intelligent system can evaluate its own performance, identify areas for improvement, and apply modifications to itself in order to achieve better outcomes. This process can be repeated indefinitely, leading to rapid advancements in capabilities and performance over time.

Recursive self-improvement has been a topic of interest and debate among scholars and researchers in various disciplines, with some arguing that it could lead to significant breakthroughs in fields such as machine learning, natural language processing, and expert systems. Others have raised concerns about the potential risks and challenges associated with this process, including the possibility of unintended consequences or exponential growth beyond human control.

This article provides an overview of the concept of recursive self-improvement, including its history, key concepts, and current state of research in the field.
