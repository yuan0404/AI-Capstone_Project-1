Dynamic Epistemic Logic is a branch of non-classical logic that extends classical propositional and predicate logics by incorporating modal operators for reasoning about knowledge, belief, and action over time. This field emerged in the late 20th century as an attempt to formalize various aspects of epistemology, including the dynamics of information acquisition, transmission, and manipulation.

Dynamic Epistemic Logic is characterized by its use of a dynamic model of knowledge, where agents' beliefs and actions evolve over time in response to changing information environments. The logic allows for the modeling of complex interactions between agents, such as cooperation, deception, and conflict, which are crucial in various fields like artificial intelligence, economics, philosophy, and social sciences.

The core of Dynamic Epistemic Logic consists of a set of modal operators that describe an agent's knowledge, belief, or action at a particular point in time, given the information available to them up to that point. These operators include the epistemic modalities, such as "K" for "knows," and the deontic modalities, which relate to obligations, permissions, and other forms of normative agency.

Dynamic Epistemic Logic has been applied in various contexts, including formalizing the norms of rationality, studying strategic interactions between agents, and modeling complex social phenomena. The logic's ability to capture the dynamic nature of information and its impact on agent behavior makes it a valuable tool for researchers seeking to understand human decision-making and collective action under uncertainty.
