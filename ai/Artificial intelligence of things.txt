Artificial intelligence of things (AIoT) refers to the integration of artificial intelligence (AI) capabilities into physical devices, vehicles, buildings, and other everyday objects, enabling them to perceive, process, and respond to environmental stimuli, as well as interact with their surroundings and humans. This concept is a rapidly evolving field that seeks to harness the potential of IoT devices to create more intelligent, autonomous, and context-aware systems.

The AIoT paradigm is built upon the convergence of three core technologies: artificial intelligence, the Internet of Things (IoT), and automation. By embedding AI algorithms into IoT devices, it becomes possible for these objects to acquire sensory capabilities, learn from experience, and adapt to changing environmental conditions, thereby transforming their role in various aspects of daily life.

The integration of AIoT has significant implications for numerous domains, including manufacturing, transportation, energy management, healthcare, and smart cities. By leveraging the potential of AIoT, organizations can create more efficient, productive, and sustainable systems, while also enhancing the overall quality of life for individuals.
