Algorithmic probability is a branch of mathematics that studies the computational foundations of probabilistic inference and decision-making. It seeks to provide a rigorous mathematical framework for understanding and modeling uncertainty in various domains, such as artificial intelligence, machine learning, and data analysis. This field has emerged from the intersection of computer science, mathematics, and statistics, with applications in areas like recommendation systems, natural language processing, and signal processing.
