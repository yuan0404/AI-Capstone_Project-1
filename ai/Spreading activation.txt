Spreading activation is a cognitive process whereby the activation state of one element in a network affects its neighboring elements, leading to a ripple effect of increased or decreased activation throughout the system. This phenomenon was first described by psychologists John Anderson and Kenneth Kosslyn in 1978 as a key mechanism underlying human memory formation and retrieval. Since then, spreading activation has been extensively studied across various fields of research, including cognitive psychology, neuroscience, artificial intelligence, and machine learning. It is now widely recognized as an essential component of many cognitive architectures and models, enabling systems to simulate human-like reasoning, decision-making, and problem-solving abilities.
