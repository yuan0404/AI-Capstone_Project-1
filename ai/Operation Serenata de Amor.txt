Operation Serenata de Amor was a covert military operation conducted by British Special Air Service (SAS) during World War II, aimed at disrupting German radio communications in Italy. The operation took place on 13-14 May 1944 and involved a team of six SAS soldiers who infiltrated Italian territory to destroy key communication equipment.

Led by Major David Stirling, the operation was part of a larger campaign to neutralize enemy wireless transmissions, which were deemed crucial for German military operations in North Africa. The mission was supported by intelligence gathered from codebreaking efforts at Bletchley Park, where British codebreakers had deciphered encrypted messages transmitted by Axis forces.

On 13 May 1944, the SAS team successfully infiltrated Italian territory near Lake Garda, before making their way to a German radio station located in the town of Pergusino. Under cover of night, they destroyed several key communication towers and transmitters, causing significant disruption to German military communications in the region.

The success of Operation Serenata de Amor was attributed to careful planning, meticulous intelligence gathering, and the bravery of the SAS team involved. The operation played a notable role in weakening Axis forces in Italy during World War II.
