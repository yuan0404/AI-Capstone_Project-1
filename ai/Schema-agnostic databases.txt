A schema-agnostic database is a type of relational database management system that allows data to be stored and queried without requiring a predefined schema or set of predefined tables. This approach enables flexibility and adaptability in handling diverse data structures and formats, making it particularly useful for applications with evolving or unpredictable data needs.

Schema-agnostic databases often employ self-descriptive metadata or other mechanisms to manage and define the structure of stored data, allowing users to explore, manipulate, and analyze their data without relying on predefined table definitions. This approach can simplify data modeling, facilitate data integration, and improve overall system performance by reducing overhead associated with rigid schema maintenance.

Key benefits of schema-agnostic databases include improved flexibility in handling diverse data sources and formats, reduced overhead from schema management, enhanced data exploration and manipulation capabilities, and the ability to adapt to changing data needs without requiring significant modifications to the underlying database infrastructure.
