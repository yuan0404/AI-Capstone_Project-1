An argumentation framework is a systematic structure used to organize, analyze, and evaluate arguments within various fields of study, including philosophy, logic, rhetoric, critical thinking, and artificial intelligence. It provides a logical framework for identifying the components, relationships, and properties of an argument, allowing individuals to assess its validity, strength, and coherence.

The concept of argumentation frameworks encompasses both theoretical and practical applications, drawing on concepts from formal semantics, model theory, categorization, machine learning, and human-computer interaction. By employing a structured approach to analyzing arguments, researchers and practitioners can improve the clarity, persuasiveness, and overall effectiveness of their arguments.

Argumentation frameworks are particularly relevant in fields where complex decision-making processes involve evaluating competing claims, hypotheses, or solutions. They enable individuals to critically assess the underlying assumptions, evidence, and reasoning that support an argument, thereby facilitating more informed and well-reasoned decision-making.
