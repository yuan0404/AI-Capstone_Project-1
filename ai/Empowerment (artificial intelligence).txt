Empowerment in Artificial Intelligence refers to the development and implementation of technologies that enable artificial systems to make decisions autonomously, leveraging their inherent capabilities and learning processes to achieve specific objectives or goals without explicit human intervention. This concept has garnered significant attention within the fields of artificial intelligence, machine learning, and cognitive science, as researchers seek to create more sophisticated and self-sufficient AI systems capable of operating effectively in a variety of complex environments.

Empowerment is often distinguished from other related concepts, such as autonomy and agency, although these terms are sometimes used interchangeably or employed to describe distinct aspects of artificial intelligence. The study of empowerment encompasses various subfields, including cognitive architectures, reinforcement learning, and social learning theory, which provide insights into the design and development of intelligent systems that can adapt, learn, and act in response to changing situations.

Theoretical frameworks and mathematical models have been proposed to explain and analyze the mechanisms underlying empowerment, highlighting the importance of factors such as internal state representation, learning algorithms, and reward functions. Empirical studies have also investigated the efficacy of various approaches to enablement, including those focused on cognitive architectures, neural networks, and hybrid systems.

This article aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the concept of empowerment in artificial intelligence, covering its theoretical foundations, key concepts, and current research directions.
