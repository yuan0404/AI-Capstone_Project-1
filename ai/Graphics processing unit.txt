A graphics processing unit (GPU) is a specialized electronic circuit designed to quickly manipulate and alter memory to accelerate the creation of images on display devices such as computers, mobile devices, and televisions. The primary function of a GPU is to perform the majority of the computational tasks required for rendering 2D and 3D graphics, video games, scientific simulations, and other compute-intensive applications. This specialized hardware has become an integral component of modern computing systems, with the widespread adoption of GPUs in various fields leading to significant advancements in areas such as artificial intelligence, machine learning, and data analytics.
