Organoid intelligence refers to the hypothetical concept of developing artificial intelligence systems based on tissue-engineered or 3D-printed organs, with the potential to replicate human brain function and cognition. The term "organoid" was first coined by scientist Dr. Shoukhrat Mitalipov in 2006 to describe a type of stem cell-derived organ-like structure that mimics the developmental process of real organs.

The concept of organoid intelligence has garnered significant attention in recent years due to advances in biotechnology and artificial intelligence. Researchers have been exploring ways to create synthetic neural networks using tissue-engineered or printed organs, which could potentially lead to breakthroughs in fields such as medicine, neuroscience, and cognitive science.

Organoid intelligence is a rapidly evolving field that draws from multiple disciplines, including stem cell biology, neurotechnology, and machine learning. As the development of this field continues, it is essential to understand its underlying principles, current applications, and potential implications for society. This article aims to provide an overview of the current state of organoid intelligence, highlighting key concepts, research advancements, and future directions in this exciting and rapidly advancing field.
