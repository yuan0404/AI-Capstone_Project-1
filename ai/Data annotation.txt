Data annotation is the process of adding labels or annotations to data, such as text, images, or audio, to provide context and meaning that can be used to train machine learning models. This process involves manual or automated labeling of the data to enable machines to understand its relevance, significance, and relationships within a dataset. The accuracy and quality of the annotations directly impact the performance and reliability of the subsequent machine learning models, making high-quality annotation a critical component of the machine learning workflow.
