An admissible heuristic is a rule or strategy used in decision-making processes that are designed to produce optimal solutions within a given problem domain. In the context of artificial intelligence and operations research, heuristics refer to a class of methods for approximating optimal solutions by exploiting known structures, patterns, and relationships within a problem. Admissible heuristics are characterized by their ability to guarantee the existence of an optimal solution within a finite number of steps or iterations.

Admissible heuristics have been widely employed in various fields, including computer science, operations research, and mathematics, due to their ability to provide fast and efficient solutions for complex problems. These heuristics often rely on mathematical models, algorithms, and data structures to identify potential solutions and evaluate their quality.

The primary goal of an admissible heuristic is to balance the trade-off between the speed and accuracy of solution generation. Effective admissible heuristics can significantly reduce computational complexity and improve problem-solving efficiency, making them a crucial component in many decision-making systems.
