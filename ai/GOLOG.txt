Golog is a programming language designed specifically for symbolic reasoning and automated reasoning. Developed by Allen Newell in the 1970s, Golog is based on the concept of goal-directed reasoning and was initially intended to be used as a general-purpose programming language for artificial intelligence applications. The language's core features revolve around the representation of goals, actions, and the rules governing their interaction, allowing users to specify complex problem-solving strategies in a structured and modular manner.
