Autonomic networking refers to a class of network management and control systems that utilize advanced artificial intelligence, machine learning, and automation techniques to create self-healing, adaptive, and resilient networks. The primary goal of autonomic networking is to enable networks to manage themselves, without human intervention, by automatically detecting and responding to changes in the network topology, traffic patterns, and other parameters.

Autonomic networking aims to achieve this through the integration of various technologies, including network management systems, artificial intelligence algorithms, and automation protocols. These technologies work together to create a closed-loop system where the network continuously monitors its own performance and adjusts its behavior accordingly. This enables autonomic networks to adapt quickly to changing network conditions, minimize downtime, and optimize network resources.

The concept of autonomic networking has been around for several decades, with various research initiatives and proof-of-concept projects demonstrating its potential. However, it has only recently gained widespread attention as a key technology for next-generation networks and the Internet of Things (IoT). With the increasing complexity and scale of modern networks, autonomic networking is becoming an essential strategy for achieving network efficiency, reliability, and scalability.

Autonomic networking has far-reaching implications for various aspects of the network ecosystem, including network operations, management, and security. It also opens up new opportunities for innovation and research, as researchers and engineers explore ways to harness the power of artificial intelligence and machine learning in network management.
