Artificial intelligence (AI) has been increasingly utilized in various military contexts, leveraging its capabilities to enhance decision-making, optimize resource allocation, and improve operational effectiveness. The integration of AI into military systems has been a subject of considerable interest and research, as it offers potential benefits such as enhanced situational awareness, improved predictive analytics, and increased autonomous decision-making.

The applications of AI in the military sphere encompass a broad range of areas, including command and control systems, intelligence gathering and analysis, cybersecurity, logistics management, and tactical operations. The deployment of AI-powered technologies has been reported in various military units around the world, with many nations investing significant resources into developing and implementing these capabilities.

Despite the benefits that AI offers to military organizations, concerns regarding its potential risks and limitations have also been raised. Issues such as bias in decision-making algorithms, cybersecurity vulnerabilities, and the need for transparency and accountability in AI-driven systems remain pressing concerns in the ongoing development of military AI applications.

This article aims to provide an overview of the current state of military AI applications, including their uses, benefits, and challenges. It will also explore the future directions of research and development in this field, as well as the implications of AI on modern warfare.
