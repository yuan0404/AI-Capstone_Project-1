Self-management is a concept in computer science that refers to the ability of a system to manage its own behavior, performance, and resources without explicit external direction or intervention. This autonomous operation enables systems to adapt, respond to changing conditions, and maintain stability, thereby improving overall efficiency and reliability. In self-managed systems, software components, algorithms, or models are designed to operate independently, making decisions based on their internal state, inputs, and feedback mechanisms.

Self-management encompasses a range of techniques, including but not limited to: autonomous system scheduling, fault-tolerant design, distributed decision-making, and dynamic reconfiguration. These strategies allow systems to dynamically adjust their behavior in response to changing conditions, such as changes in workload, network connectivity, or hardware resources. By harnessing self-managing capabilities, developers can create more resilient, adaptive, and efficient software systems that can operate effectively in a wide range of environments.

Key applications of self-management include distributed computing, cloud computing, and edge computing, where the need for adaptability, scalability, and fault-tolerance is particularly critical. Researchers and practitioners are actively exploring ways to integrate self-management principles into various domains, including artificial intelligence, machine learning, and cybersecurity.
