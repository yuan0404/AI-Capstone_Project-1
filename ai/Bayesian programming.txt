Bayesian programming is a subfield of artificial intelligence that combines elements of machine learning and decision theory to develop probabilistic algorithms for solving complex problems. It is based on Bayes' theorem, which describes how to update the probability of a hypothesis given new evidence. Bayesian programming has numerous applications in various fields, including data science, computer vision, natural language processing, and robotics. The field relies on mathematical techniques from statistics, probability theory, and optimization to develop algorithms that can effectively handle uncertainty and ambiguity in complex decision-making scenarios.
