The situated approach is a subfield of artificial intelligence that focuses on the development of autonomous systems capable of interacting with their environment. It emphasizes the importance of understanding the context in which an agent operates, rather than solely relying on symbolic representations or abstract problem-solving techniques. By integrating knowledge of the physical and social world into the design process, situated approaches aim to create more robust, flexible, and human-like intelligent systems.
