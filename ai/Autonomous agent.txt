An autonomous agent is a self-contained computational entity that operates independently within a defined environment, making decisions and taking actions based on its internal state and external stimuli without direct human intervention or control. Autonomous agents are designed to perceive their surroundings, process information, and adapt to changing conditions through a combination of sensors, algorithms, and machine learning techniques. The concept of autonomous agents has far-reaching implications across various fields, including artificial intelligence, robotics, finance, and healthcare, enabling the development of complex systems that can interact with and respond to their environment in a dynamic and adaptive manner.
