A smart object is a type of device or system that incorporates sensors, software, and networking capabilities to enable intelligent behavior, autonomous decision-making, and real-time communication with humans and other devices. This emerging class of objects has been increasingly being integrated into various aspects of modern life, including consumer electronics, industrial automation, healthcare, and transportation systems.

Characterized by their ability to collect and process data from internal and external sources, smart objects can adapt to changing environments and perform tasks autonomously, often with minimal human intervention. The integration of artificial intelligence, machine learning algorithms, and the Internet of Things (IoT) enables smart objects to learn, reason, and interact with users and other devices in a more intuitive and effective manner.

The development and deployment of smart objects have significant implications for various industries, including manufacturing, logistics, energy management, and customer service. As these technologies continue to evolve, they are expected to transform the way we live, work, and interact with one another.
