A computer audition is a process by which a candidate's technical skills, often used in the hiring or selection of individuals for various professional roles, are evaluated through digital means. This method has become increasingly prevalent as technology advances and face-to-face interactions become less common. Computer auditions can be utilized for both initial screenings and final assessments, allowing organizations to efficiently assess candidates' qualifications while minimizing the need for in-person meetings.

The process typically involves a series of computer-based tasks or exercises designed to test specific skills, such as coding proficiency, data analysis, or software application expertise. The results are often evaluated using standardized metrics or assessment tools, providing a quantitative measure of the candidate's abilities. Computer auditions can also be used in conjunction with other evaluation methods, such as interviews or written exams, to provide a more comprehensive understanding of a candidate's qualifications.

The use of computer auditions has been adopted by various industries, including tech, finance, and healthcare, due to their ability to streamline the hiring process and reduce costs associated with traditional recruitment methods. As technology continues to evolve, it is likely that computer auditions will play an increasingly important role in modern employment practices.
