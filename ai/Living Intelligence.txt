Living intelligence refers to the hypothetical concept that life is a cognitive process, imbuing organisms with intelligent behavior, rather than solely relying on instinct or chemical reactions. This notion challenges traditional views of evolution and the nature of consciousness, proposing that all living beings possess some degree of mental faculties, enabling them to adapt, learn, and problem-solve in their environments. The idea of living intelligence has garnered interest among philosophers, scientists, and scholars across various disciplines, including biology, psychology, artificial intelligence, and cognitive science.
