Business Process Automation refers to the use of technology and software to automate and streamline business processes, thereby increasing efficiency, reducing errors, and improving overall productivity. This approach involves redesigning and integrating existing workflows to leverage robotic process automation (RPA), artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning (ML), and other digital tools to optimize business operations. By automating repetitive and mundane tasks, organizations can free up human resources for more strategic and creative endeavors, leading to enhanced competitiveness and innovation in the marketplace.
