Artificial Intelligence for Operations (AIOps) is a subfield of artificial intelligence that focuses on using machine learning and data analytics to monitor, analyze, and optimize complex IT operations. This field emerged as an extension of traditional network management and automation techniques, with the aim of automating the decision-making process and reducing manual intervention in IT operations.

The term AIOps was first coined by Andrew van der Merwe, CEO of Luminar Systems, in 2016. The field draws inspiration from the rapidly growing capabilities of machine learning algorithms and the increasing availability of large datasets generated by IoT devices, sensors, and other sources of operational data. By integrating these technologies, AIOps aims to provide real-time insights into IT operations, enabling faster detection and resolution of issues, improved service levels, and reduced costs.

AIOps applications have expanded beyond traditional network management, embracing a wide range of domains such as cloud computing, cybersecurity, data analytics, and more. This growth is driven by the increasing demand for efficient and scalable IT operations management, particularly in the era of digital transformation, where organizations must navigate complex networks, systems, and applications to remain competitive.
