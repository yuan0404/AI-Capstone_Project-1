Moral outsourcing refers to the practice of delegating ethical responsibilities or moral obligations to external entities, such as governments, international organizations, or other parties, rather than taking personal responsibility for one's actions or decisions. This phenomenon has become increasingly prominent in recent years, particularly in the context of global commerce, international relations, and human rights. Moral outsourcing can take various forms, including the offshoring of moral burdens to other nations or communities, the outsourcing of ethical decision-making processes to external consultants or experts, or the delegation of moral authority to institutional entities such as corporations or NGOs. By examining moral outsourcing in its multiple contexts and manifestations, this concept sheds light on the complex dynamics of global morality, the shifting boundaries of personal responsibility, and the evolving nature of ethical obligations in an increasingly interconnected world.
