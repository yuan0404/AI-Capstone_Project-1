POP-11 was a pioneering computer programming language designed to be an efficient and flexible alternative to existing systems. Developed in the 1970s by a team led by Michael H. Wright at the Institute for Defense Analyses (IDA), POP-11 was initially intended as a tool for solving complex problems and modeling real-world systems in a concise and readable manner. The language's architecture is based on an abstract syntax tree data structure, which allows for efficient manipulation of programming constructs and enables the creation of high-performance code. With its unique blend of simplicity and expressiveness, POP-11 has been recognized as one of the most influential programming languages of the late 20th century, with significant contributions to various fields, including artificial intelligence, computer science, and mathematics.
