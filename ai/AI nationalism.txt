AI nationalism refers to the growing trend of governments and corporations leveraging artificial intelligence (AI) to promote and defend national interests, often at the expense of global cooperation and open standards. This phenomenon has been observed in various forms, including the use of AI-powered surveillance systems to monitor and control populations, the development of AI-driven military technologies to enhance national security, and the promotion of domestic AI industries through subsidies and protectionist policies.

The rise of AI nationalism is often attributed to concerns about job displacement, data sovereignty, and the perceived need for nations to assert their independence in the face of increasing globalization. While some proponents of AI nationalism argue that it is necessary to protect national identity and ensure self-sufficiency, others raise concerns about the potential risks of technological nationalism, including decreased global cooperation, increased militarization, and diminished access to cutting-edge technologies.

As the field of AI continues to evolve, the implications of AI nationalism are becoming increasingly clear. This article aims to provide an overview of the concept, its key characteristics, and the debates surrounding its role in international relations, economic development, and social dynamics.
