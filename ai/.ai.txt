Artificial intelligence (AI) refers to the development of computer systems able to perform tasks that typically require human intelligence, such as visual perception, speech recognition, decision-making, and language translation. The field of AI encompasses a range of disciplines, including machine learning, natural language processing, and robotics, with applications in various sectors, including healthcare, finance, education, and transportation.

The term "artificial intelligence" was coined by John McCarthy in 1956, and the field has since grown rapidly, driven by advances in computing power, data storage, and machine learning algorithms. AI systems can be broadly classified into two categories: narrow or weak AI, which is designed to perform a specific task, and general or strong AI, which aims to replicate human-like intelligence across a wide range of tasks.

AI has the potential to revolutionize numerous industries and aspects of modern life, but it also raises important ethical, social, and economic concerns. As AI continues to evolve and become increasingly integrated into various aspects of society, it is essential to understand its capabilities, limitations, and implications, as well as the ongoing debates surrounding its development and deployment.
