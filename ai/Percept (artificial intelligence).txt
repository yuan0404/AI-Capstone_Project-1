In the field of artificial intelligence, a percept refers to a fundamental concept that enables machines to interpret and understand visual data from their environment. A percept is a complex cognitive process by which an agent, typically a computer program or robot, extracts meaningful information from sensory inputs, such as images, videos, or point clouds. This information is then used to inform decision-making, action planning, and interaction with the physical world. Percepts are often considered the building blocks of perception and cognition in artificial intelligence systems, as they provide the basis for further processing and interpretation of sensor data.
