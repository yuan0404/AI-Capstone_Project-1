Cognitive philology is a multidisciplinary field that seeks to understand how language relates to cognitive processes and the human mind. It draws upon insights from linguistics, psychology, philosophy, anthropology, and computer science to investigate the intricate connections between language use, thought, perception, and cognition. Cognitive philologists explore how linguistic structures, semantic fields, and pragmatic contexts influence our understanding of meaning, semantics, and pragmatics, as well as the complex interactions between language, culture, and cognition. This field aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of the cognitive mechanisms underlying human communication, shedding light on the dynamic and reciprocal relationships between language, thought, and reality.
