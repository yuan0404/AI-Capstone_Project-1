Artificial intelligence (AI) literacy refers to the ability to understand, analyze, and apply knowledge about artificial intelligence systems, their capabilities, limitations, and potential impacts on society. As AI technologies continue to advance and become increasingly integrated into various aspects of modern life, it has become essential for individuals, organizations, and communities to possess a basic understanding of AI concepts, principles, and best practices.

AI literacy encompasses a range of knowledge domains, including machine learning, deep learning, natural language processing, computer vision, and robotics. It also involves an understanding of the social, economic, and ethical implications of AI adoption, such as job displacement, bias in decision-making systems, and data privacy concerns. Effective AI literacy requires a multidisciplinary approach, drawing on expertise from fields like computer science, sociology, philosophy, and policy-making.

The development of AI literacy has significant implications for individuals, organizations, and societies as a whole. It enables informed decision-making, mitigates potential risks, and fosters a culture of responsible innovation. As the world grapples with the challenges and opportunities presented by AI, it is essential to cultivate a broad and nuanced understanding of this complex and rapidly evolving field.
