Explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) refers to the development of artificial intelligence (AI) systems that provide transparent and interpretable explanations for their decisions, actions, and outcomes. This field aims to address the concerns surrounding the lack of understanding and accountability in AI decision-making processes, particularly in high-stakes applications such as healthcare, finance, and transportation. By providing insights into the reasoning and decision-making mechanisms underlying AI systems, XAI seeks to establish trust and credibility in AI-driven solutions, ultimately enabling more informed decision-making and improved outcomes.
