A software agent is a computer program designed to perform automated tasks on behalf of a human user or another entity, often exhibiting intelligent behavior through machine learning algorithms and natural language processing capabilities. The development of software agents enables machines to execute complex decision-making processes, interact with users, and adapt to changing environments, thereby augmenting the functionality of existing systems.

Historically, the concept of software agents emerged in the late 1980s as a distinct area of research within artificial intelligence (AI) and computer science. Since then, significant advances have been made in developing software agent architectures, protocols, and platforms that enable their widespread adoption across various industries and applications.

Software agents can be categorized into different types based on their characteristics, such as autonomous, semi-autonomous, or hybrid agents, which reflect varying levels of human oversight and intervention. These categories are often used to distinguish between more straightforward automation tasks and those requiring greater degrees of adaptability and decision-making capabilities.

This article aims to provide an overview of software agents, including their key concepts, types, applications, and challenges.
