Data science and predictive analytics are rapidly evolving fields that have emerged as crucial components of modern data-driven decision-making. At its core, data science refers to the process of extracting insights and knowledge from complex datasets, typically using machine learning algorithms and statistical modeling techniques. Predictive analytics is a subset of data science that focuses specifically on using historical data and statistical models to forecast future outcomes or behaviors.

As organizations increasingly rely on data-driven decision-making to inform strategic choices, there has been a growing demand for professionals with expertise in data science and predictive analytics. The application of these fields spans a wide range of industries, including finance, healthcare, marketing, and supply chain management, among others.
