Artificial Intelligence Washing refers to the practice of presenting biased or misleading information as factual or neutral through the use of artificial intelligence (AI) tools and algorithms. This phenomenon has been observed in various forms of media, including news outlets, social media platforms, and online content providers. The use of AI washing can serve to manipulate public opinion, distort facts, and undermine trust in credible sources of information. As AI technologies continue to advance and become increasingly pervasive, the risk of AI washing grows, highlighting the need for critical evaluation and scrutiny of information presented through these channels.
