The toy problem is a fundamental concept in decision theory and game theory, which has been extensively studied in economics, psychology, and computer science. The core issue it addresses involves a simple yet intriguing scenario: an individual with two options for distributing identical items among themselves and others, where the distribution leads to an optimal outcome for one party but suboptimal outcomes for the other.

This problem has its roots in the early 20th century and was initially used as a thought experiment to illustrate the differences between rational behavior under perfect information versus imperfect information. The concept gained prominence with John Nash's 1950 solution, which proposed that when the two individuals involved can only observe their own payoffs but not those of others, each individual will choose the action that leads to the highest expected payoff for themselves, regardless of how the outcome affects the other party.

The toy problem has far-reaching implications in fields such as behavioral economics, bargaining theory, and mechanism design. It provides a framework for analyzing strategic interactions between individuals with limited information, making it a crucial tool for understanding decision-making processes under uncertainty.
