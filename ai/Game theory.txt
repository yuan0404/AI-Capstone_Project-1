Game theory is a branch of mathematics that studies strategic decision-making in situations where the outcome depends on the actions of multiple individuals or parties. It provides a framework for analyzing and predicting the behavior of players in various competitive and cooperative settings, such as business, economics, politics, and social interactions. At its core, game theory examines how individuals make rational decisions when their choices are interdependent with those of others, often resulting in conflicts of interest or mutually beneficial outcomes. The field draws on concepts from mathematics, statistics, psychology, and sociology to understand the complexities of human behavior in situations where multiple stakeholders have conflicting interests. By developing mathematical models and analytical techniques, game theory aims to provide insights into optimal strategies for decision-makers, predict the likelihood of certain outcomes, and inform policy-making and other real-world applications.
