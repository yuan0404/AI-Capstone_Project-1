A connectionist expert system is a type of artificial intelligence approach that employs neural networks to mimic human decision-making processes in complex systems. This paradigm is derived from the field of connectionism, which emphasizes the idea that knowledge representation and problem-solving can be achieved through the interactions among interconnected nodes or "neurons" rather than traditional symbol manipulation.

The concept of connectionist expert systems has its roots in the 1980s, where researchers began exploring the potential of neural networks to model expert knowledge in various domains. These early systems were often based on simple architectures, such as feedforward networks, and were primarily used for rule-based reasoning tasks.

Over time, advances in computing power and algorithmic developments have led to the evolution of more sophisticated connectionist expert systems, including recurrent neural networks and long short-term memory (LSTM) networks. These newer architectures have enabled the development of systems capable of learning complex patterns and relationships within large datasets, thereby improving their performance on a wide range of applications.

This article will provide an overview of connectionist expert systems, discussing their key components, advantages, limitations, and applications in various fields.
