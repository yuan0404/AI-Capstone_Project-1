The Alignment Research Center is an initiative focused on developing advanced artificial intelligence (AI) that can navigate complex moral and societal dilemmas without compromising its objectives. Launched in 2018 by Elon Musk and other prominent figures in the tech industry, the center's primary objective is to ensure that future AI systems are designed with safety and control measures in place to mitigate the risks of uncontrolled development.

Located in San Francisco, California, the Alignment Research Center is a collaborative effort between researchers, engineers, and policymakers from various backgrounds. The center aims to create a comprehensive framework for developing AI systems that can operate within predetermined parameters, avoiding potential catastrophic consequences such as superintelligence or unforeseen side effects on human society.

Key research areas include decision-theoretic formalisms, causal inference, and reinforcement learning, among others. The alignment research program has garnered significant attention from the scientific community and policymakers due to its emphasis on ensuring that advanced AI systems prioritize human well-being and societal stability over their own optimization objectives.
