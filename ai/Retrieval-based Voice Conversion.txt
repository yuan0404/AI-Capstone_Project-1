Retrieval-based voice conversion is a subfield of deep learning that enables the automated transformation of one individual's voice into another's by leveraging large-scale databases of audio recordings from various sources. This technique has garnered significant attention in recent years due to its potential applications in fields such as dubbing, voice modulation, and synthetic speech generation. By utilizing retrieval-based methods, researchers have successfully demonstrated the ability to convert a speaker's voice into a target voice with remarkable accuracy, paving the way for further exploration of this technology's possibilities.
