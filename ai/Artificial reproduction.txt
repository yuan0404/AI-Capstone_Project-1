Artificial reproduction refers to the process of creating biological offspring through non-natural means, involving various scientific and technological techniques. This concept has garnered significant attention in recent years due to advancements in biotechnology, genetic engineering, and reproductive medicine. Artificial reproduction encompasses a range of methods, including in vitro fertilization (IVF), surrogacy, and egg donation, among others. These methods aim to address various challenges associated with traditional reproductive processes, such as infertility, limited egg or sperm availability, and increasing demand for reproductive services. Despite its growing importance, the field of artificial reproduction remains a subject of ongoing debate and discussion regarding ethics, safety, and efficacy.
