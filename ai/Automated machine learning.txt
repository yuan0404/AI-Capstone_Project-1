Automated machine learning refers to the process of automatically discovering and selecting optimal machine learning models from a set of candidate algorithms based on a given dataset without requiring explicit manual intervention or human expertise. This approach leverages advanced computational methods and algorithms to identify patterns, relationships, and features within the data that can be used to improve model performance and accuracy.

At its core, automated machine learning involves the use of automated hyperparameter tuning, feature engineering, and model selection techniques to optimize the performance of machine learning models on a given problem or task. By automating these tasks, practitioners can reduce the time and effort required to develop and deploy machine learning solutions, while also improving their ability to identify the most effective algorithms and configurations for complex real-world problems.

Automated machine learning has been increasingly adopted in various fields, including computer vision, natural language processing, recommender systems, and predictive analytics. The technique has numerous benefits, including increased efficiency, reduced expertise requirements, and improved model performance. However, it also raises important questions regarding the interpretation of results, explainability, and transparency in automated decision-making processes.

This article aims to provide an overview of automated machine learning, its key concepts, techniques, and applications, as well as its current state of development and future directions.
