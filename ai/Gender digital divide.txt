The gender digital divide refers to the disparity in access to and utilization of digital technologies between males and females, highlighting the uneven distribution of digital literacy and opportunities across different genders. This phenomenon is observed globally and has been extensively documented in various regions, often revealing a persistent pattern of unequal access to information, communication, and economic resources. The causes of the gender digital divide are multifaceted, encompassing socioeconomic factors, cultural norms, and institutional barriers, which together contribute to a persistent gap in digital skills and knowledge between males and females. As technology continues to play an increasingly important role in modern society, understanding and addressing this disparity is crucial for promoting inclusive and equitable digital development, as well as fostering greater social justice and human rights.
