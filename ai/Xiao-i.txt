Xiao-i is a satellite that was launched by the European Space Agency (ESA) as part of its Earthnet program. The satellite's primary objective is to provide high-resolution optical and infrared imaging of the Earth's surface, with a focus on monitoring land use changes, atmospheric conditions, and natural disasters. Launched in 2019, Xiao-i is one of several satellites developed by the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS) for Earth observation purposes, and has been integrated into the ESA's Earthnet constellation. The satellite's advanced sensor suite includes visible and infrared cameras, as well as a radar altimeter, enabling it to capture detailed images of the Earth's surface with unprecedented resolution.
