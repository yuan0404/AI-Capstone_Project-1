Computational intelligence refers to a broad field of research that focuses on developing intelligent systems capable of solving complex problems in various domains. It encompasses a range of disciplines, including artificial intelligence, machine learning, robotics, and cognitive science, which converge to create systems that can perceive, reason, and act autonomously.

At its core, computational intelligence seeks to replicate the human-like capabilities of intelligent beings through the use of algorithms, data structures, and software frameworks. By leveraging advances in computer science, mathematics, and engineering, researchers aim to design systems that can learn, adapt, and evolve over time, enabling them to tackle intricate problems that would be challenging or impossible for humans to solve manually.

The field of computational intelligence has numerous applications across various industries, including but not limited to healthcare, finance, transportation, and education. It is also being explored in the development of autonomous vehicles, smart homes, and other innovative technologies that require sophisticated decision-making and problem-solving capabilities.
