Artificial intelligence (AI) alignment refers to the pursuit of developing artificial intelligent systems that can achieve human values and behave in ways that are aligned with human well-being and goals. This field seeks to address the potential risks associated with advanced AI systems, such as superintelligence, by designing them to prioritize human values and prevent harm. The goal of AI alignment is to create intelligent machines that can operate effectively within a human-centered framework, ensuring that their actions align with human moral principles and promote the greater good.
