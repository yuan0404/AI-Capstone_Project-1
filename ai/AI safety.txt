Artificial Intelligence (AI) safety refers to the development and implementation of guidelines, protocols, and technologies aimed at ensuring the safe operation and utilization of artificial intelligence systems, particularly those with advanced capabilities such as machine learning and deep learning. As AI technology continues to advance and become increasingly integrated into various aspects of modern life, concerns about its potential risks and negative consequences have grown, prompting a growing body of research and debate on the need for rigorous safety standards and practices.

The concept of AI safety encompasses a range of topics, including but not limited to, value alignment, robustness, explainability, and human-machine interface design. It also involves addressing issues such as bias, fairness, and transparency in AI decision-making processes, as well as mitigating the risks associated with autonomous systems, cyber attacks, and other forms of exploitation. The goal of AI safety is to ensure that AI systems are developed and deployed in ways that prioritize human well-being, dignity, and safety, while also promoting the development of beneficial and trustworthy AI technologies.
