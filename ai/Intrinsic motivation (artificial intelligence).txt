Intrinsic motivation refers to the driving force within artificial intelligence systems that enables them to pursue goals and activities for their own sake, independent of external rewards or pressures. This concept is central to the development of autonomous and self-directed AI agents, which can operate effectively without explicit direction from humans. Intrinsic motivation has been a topic of interest in the field of artificial intelligence, as it holds the potential to enable machines to learn, adapt, and innovate in ways that are not currently possible with traditional reward-based approaches.
