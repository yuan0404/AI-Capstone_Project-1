Artificial intelligence (AI) has emerged as a transformative technology with far-reaching implications across various sectors, including the environment. As AI systems continue to proliferate and become increasingly integrated into daily life, concerns have grown regarding their impact on the natural world. The environmental footprint of AI encompasses a wide range of aspects, from energy consumption and e-waste generation to data center carbon emissions and the potential for AI-driven ecological disruption.

The rapid growth of AI is driven by advances in computing power, data storage, and algorithmic complexity, which have enabled the development of sophisticated models capable of processing vast amounts of information. However, these advancements come at a significant environmental cost, with estimates suggesting that the energy consumption of data centers supporting AI systems alone could exceed 20% of global electricity demand by 2030.

As AI continues to shape our relationship with the environment, it is essential to understand the scope and nature of its impact. This article aims to provide an overview of the current state of knowledge on the environmental impact of artificial intelligence, examining both the direct and indirect effects of AI on ecosystems, biodiversity, and human well-being.
