Symbolic artificial intelligence (AI) is a subfield of artificial intelligence that focuses on creating intelligent systems capable of reasoning, problem-solving, and knowledge representation through symbolic computations. This approach emphasizes the use of explicit representations, such as logic and rules-based systems, to capture and manipulate knowledge.

At its core, symbolic AI seeks to replicate human cognitive abilities by representing and manipulating symbols, rather than relying solely on machine learning algorithms that learn from data. By leveraging mathematical formalisms and logical frameworks, symbolic AI aims to provide a more transparent, interpretable, and controllable approach to intelligent systems.

Symbolic AI has been explored in various domains, including natural language processing, expert systems, and computer vision, with applications ranging from decision support systems to robotics and autonomous vehicles. Its development has also spawned numerous research areas, such as symbolic learning, knowledge graphs, and formal methods for verifying the correctness of AI systems.
