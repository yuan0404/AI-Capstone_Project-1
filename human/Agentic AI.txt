Agentic AI is a class of artificial intelligence that focuses on autonomous systems that can make decisions and perform tasks without human intervention. The independent systems automatically respond to conditions, to produce process results. The field is closely linked to agentic automation, also known as agent-based process management systems (APMS), when applied to process automation. Applications include software development, customer support, cybersecurity and business intelligence.
