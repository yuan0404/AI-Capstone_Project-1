Gender digital divide is defined as gender biases coded into technology products, technology sector, and digital skills education. It can refer to women's and other gender identity's use of, and professional development in computing work. The gender digital divide has changed throughout history due to social roles, economics, and educational opportunities. As the gender spectrum continues to exist more prominently in social and professional spaces, the inclusion of other identities is an important area of concern in these types of conversations. These other identities can include any other than cis-gender male. Non-binary people make up a significant portion of the population and their existence is affected by the digital divide nonetheless.
