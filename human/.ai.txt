.ai is the Internet country code top-level domain (ccTLD) for Anguilla, a British Overseas Territory in the Caribbean. It is administered by the government of Anguilla.
It is a popular domain hack with companies and projects related to the artificial intelligence industry (AI).
Google's ad targeting treats .ai as a generic top-level domain (gTLD) because "users and website owners frequently see [the domain] as being more generic than country-targeted."
Identity Digital began managing the domain as of January 2025.
