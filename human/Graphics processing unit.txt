A graphics processing unit (GPU) is a specialized electronic circuit initially designed for digital image processing and to accelerate computer graphics, being present either as a discrete video card or embedded on motherboards, mobile phones, personal computers, workstations, and game consoles. After their initial design, GPUs were found to be useful for non-graphic calculations involving embarrassingly parallel problems due to their parallel structure. GPUs ability to perform vast numbers of calculations rapidly has led to their adoption in diverse fields including artificial intelligence (AI) where it excels at handling data-intensive and computationally demanding tasks. Other non-graphical uses include the training of neural networks and cryptocurrency mining. With increasing use of GPUs in non-graphical applications, mainly AI, the term GPU is also erroneously used to describe specialized electronic circuits designed purely for AI and other specialized applications.
