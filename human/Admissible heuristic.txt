In computer science, specifically in algorithms related to pathfinding, a heuristic function is said to be admissible if it never overestimates the cost of reaching the goal, i.e. the cost it estimates to reach the goal is not higher than the lowest possible cost from the current point in the path. In other words, it should act as a lower bound.
It is related to the concept of consistent heuristics. While all consistent heuristics are admissible, not all admissible heuristics are consistent.
