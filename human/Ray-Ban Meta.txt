Ray-Ban Meta is a range of smartglasses created by Meta Platforms and EssilorLuxottica. They include two cameras, open-ear speakers, a microphone, and touchpad built into the frame. They are latest in a line of smartglasses released by major companies including Snap Inc and Google and are designed as one component of Facebook’s plans for a metaverse. 
Unlike other smart glasses, the Ray-Ban Meta glasses do not include any HUD or AR head-mounted display. Meta announced them on September 27, 2023. They use a Qualcomm Snapdragon AR1 Gen1 processor, upgrade of the cameras to 12 MP, improved audio, livestreaming to Facebook and Instagram, and Meta AI. On April 23, 2024, Meta announced an update to Meta AI on the smart glasses to enable multimodal input via Computer vision.
They received criticism stemming from mistrust over Facebook’s privacy controls. The small size of the recording indicator light has also led to criticism.
