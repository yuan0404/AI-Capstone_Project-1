The Artificial Intelligence of Things (AIoT) is the combination of artificial intelligence (AI) technologies with the Internet of things (IoT) infrastructure to achieve more efficient IoT operations, improve human-machine interactions and enhance data management and analytics.

In 2018, KPMG published a foresight study on the future of AI including scenarios until 2040. The analysts describe a scenario in detail where a community of things would see each device also contain its own AI that could link autonomously to other AIs to, together, perform tasks intelligently. Value creation would be controlled and executed in real-time using swarm intelligence. Many industries could be transformed with the application of swarm intelligence, including: automotive, cloud, medical, military, research, and technology.
In the AIoT an important facet is AI being done on some Thing. In its purest form this involves performing the AI on the device, i.e. at the edge or Edge Computing, with no need for external connections. There is no need for an Internet in AIoT, it is an evolution of the concept of the IoT and that is where the comparison ends.
The combined power of AI and IoT, promises to unlock unrealized customer value in a broad swath of industry verticals such as edge analytics, autonomous vehicles, personalized fitness, remote healthcare, precision agriculture, smart retail, predictive maintenance, and industrial automation.
