AI literacy or artificial intelligence literacy, is the ability to understand, use, monitor, and critically reflect on AI applications. The term usually refers to teaching skills and knowledge to the general public, particularly those who are not adept in AI.
Some think AI literacy is essential for school and college students, while some professors ban AI in the classroom and from all assignments with stern punishments for using AI, classifying it as cheating. AI is employed in a variety of applications, including self-driving automobiles and Virtual assistants. Users of these tools should be able to make informed decisions. AI literacy may have an impact students' future employment prospects.
