Epistemic modal logic is a subfield of modal logic that is concerned with reasoning about knowledge.  While epistemology has a long philosophical tradition dating back to Ancient Greece, epistemic logic is a much more recent development with applications in many fields, including philosophy, theoretical computer science, artificial intelligence, economics, and linguistics.  While philosophers since Aristotle have discussed modal logic, and Medieval philosophers such as Avicenna, Ockham, and Duns Scotus developed many of their observations, it was C. I. Lewis who created the first symbolic and systematic approach to the topic, in 1912.  It continued to mature as a field, reaching its modern form in 1963 with the work of Saul Kripke.
