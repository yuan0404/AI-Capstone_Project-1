Artificial intelligence in education (AIEd) is the application of AI in educational settings. The field combines elements of generative AI, data-driven decision-making, AI ethics, data-privacy and AI literacy. An educator might learn to use these AI systems as tools and generate code, text or rich media or optimize their digital content production. Or a governmental body might see AI as an ideological project to normalize centralized power and decision making, while public schools and higher education contend with increasing privatization.
The different definitions of AIEd are contested and can result in confusion about what exactly is being discussed.
