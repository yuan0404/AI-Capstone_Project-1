Virtual intelligence (VI) is the term given to artificial intelligence that exists within a virtual world. Many virtual worlds have options for persistent avatars that provide information, training, role-playing, and social interactions.
The immersion of virtual worlds provides a platform for VI beyond the traditional paradigm of past user interfaces (UIs). What Alan Turing established as the benchmark for telling the difference between human and computerized intelligence was done void of visual influences. With today's VI bots, virtual intelligence has evolved past the constraints of past testing into a new level of the machine's ability to demonstrate intelligence. The immersive features of these environments provide nonverbal elements that affect the realism provided by virtually intelligent agents.
Virtual intelligence is the intersection of these two technologies:

Virtual environments: Immersive 3D spaces provide for collaboration, simulations, and role-playing interactions for training.  Many of these virtual environments are currently being used for government and academic projects, including Second Life, VastPark, Olive, OpenSim, Outerra, Oracle's Open Wonderland, Duke University's Open Cobalt, and many others.  Some of the commercial virtual worlds are also taking this technology into new directions, including the high-definition virtual world Blue Mars.
Artificial intelligence: Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a branch of computer science that aims to create intelligent machines capable of performing tasks that typically require human intelligence. AI technology seeks to mimic human behavior and intelligence through computational algorithms and data analysis. Within the realm of AI, there is a specialized area known as Virtual Intelligence (VI), which operates within virtual environments to simulate human-like interactions and responses.
