Knowledge compilation is a family of approaches for addressing the intractability of
a number of artificial intelligence problems.
A propositional model is compiled in an off-line phase in order to support some queries in polynomial time. Many ways of compiling a propositional model exist.
Different compiled representations have different properties.
The three main properties are:

The compactness of the representation
The queries that are supported in polynomial time
The transformations of the representations that can be performed in polynomial time
