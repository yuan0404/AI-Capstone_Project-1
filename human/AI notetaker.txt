An AI notetaker is a tool using artificial intelligence to take notes during meetings. They are created by tech companies such as Microsoft and Google; by AI transcription services such as Otter.ai and Fireflies.ai; and by smaller firms such as Circleback, Fathom, Granola, and Krisp. Some business executives send AI notetakers to attend meetings not only to take notes, but also to answer questions on their behalf. 
The use of AI notetakers raises ethical questions, including recording meetings without the consent of all participants and the possibility that the notetaker will hallucinate and misrepresent what was said during meetings.
