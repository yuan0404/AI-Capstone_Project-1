In artificial intelligence research,  commonsense knowledge consists of facts about the everyday world, such as "Lemons are sour", or "Cows say moo", that all humans are expected to know.  It is currently an unsolved problem in artificial general intelligence. The first AI program to address common sense knowledge was Advice Taker in 1959 by John McCarthy.
Commonsense knowledge  can underpin a commonsense reasoning process, to attempt inferences such as "You might bake a cake because you want people to eat the cake."  A natural language processing process can be attached to the commonsense knowledge base to allow the knowledge base to attempt to answer questions about the world. Common sense knowledge also helps to solve problems in the face of incomplete information.  Using widely held beliefs about everyday objects, or common sense knowledge, AI systems make common sense assumptions or default assumptions about the unknown similar to the way people do.  In an AI system or in English, this is expressed  as "Normally P holds", "Usually P" or "Typically P so Assume P".   For example, if we know the fact "Tweety is a bird", because we know the commonly held belief about birds, "typically birds fly," without knowing anything else about Tweety, we may reasonably assume the fact that "Tweety can fly."  As more knowledge of the world is discovered or learned over time, the AI system can revise its assumptions about Tweety using a truth maintenance process.  If we later learn that "Tweety is a penguin" then truth maintenance revises this assumption because we also know "penguins do not fly".
