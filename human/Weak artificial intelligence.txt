Weak artificial intelligence (weak AI) is artificial intelligence that implements a limited part of the mind, or, as Artificial Narrow Intelligence, is focused on one narrow task. 
Weak AI is contrasted with strong AI, which can be interpreted in various ways: 

Artificial general intelligence (AGI): a machine with the ability to apply intelligence to any problem, rather than just one specific problem.
Artificial super intelligence (ASI): a machine with a vastly superior intelligence to the average human being.
Artificial consciousness: a machine that has consciousness, sentience and mind (John Searle uses "strong AI" in this sense).
Narrow AI can be classified as being "limited to a single, narrowly defined task. Most modern AI systems would be classified in this category." Artificial general intelligence is conversely the opposite.
