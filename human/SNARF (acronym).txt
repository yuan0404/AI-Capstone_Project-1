SNARF (stands for Stakes Novelty Anger Retention Fear) is the kind of content that evolves when a platform asks an AI to maximize usage. Content creators need to please the AI algorithms or they become irrelevant. Millions of creators make SNARF content to stay in the feed and earn a living.
The term was coined by Jonah Peretti, CEO and founder of BuzzFeed, to describe the type of digital content designed to maximize engagement on platforms driven by artificial intelligence. According to Peretti, content platform algorithms tend to favor materials that evoke strong emotions, such as anger and fear, because they keep users engaged and encourage them to continue consuming similar content.
The term describes how millions of creators attempt to tailor their content to the algorithm's demands in order to maintain visibility on platforms and earn a living. According to Peretti, the result is a flood of content designed to capture attention at any cost, sometimes at the expense of accuracy, ethics, or quality. He argues that the combination of strong emotions and constant novelty in content keeps users glued to their screens for longer periods, leading to higher profits for the platforms.
As part of his critique of this trend, Peretti announced his intention to develop a new social platform as an alternative to existing models. This platform, called "BF Island," is designed to promote self-expression, interactive experiences, and AI tools that support creativity rather than emotional manipulation. The initiative aims to offer a new model of digital content that fosters deeper and more meaningful experiences for users.
