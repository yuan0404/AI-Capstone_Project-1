The expression techâ€“industrial complex describes the relationship between a country's tech industry and its influence on the concentration of wealth, censorship or manipulation of algorithms to push an agenda, spread of misinformation and disinformation via social media and artificial intelligence, and public policy. The expression is used to describe Big Tech, Silicon Valley, and the largest IT companies in the world. The term is related to the military-industrial complex, and has been used to describe the United States Armed Forces and its adoption of AI-enabled weapons systems. The expression was popularized after a warning of the relationship's detrimental effects, in the farewell address of U.S. President Joe Biden on January 15, 2025.
