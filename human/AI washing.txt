AI washing is a deceptive marketing tactic that consists of promoting a product or a service by overstating the role of artificial intelligence (AI) integration in it. It raises concerns regarding transparency, consumer trust in the AI industry, and compliance with security regulations, potentially hampering legitimate advancements in AI. U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) chairman Gary Gensler compared it to greenwashing. AI washing ranges from the use of buzzwords attached to products such as "smart" or "machine-learning," to more blatant cases of companies claiming to have used AI in their products or services, without actually having used AI.
The term "AI washing" was first defined by the AI Now Institute, a research institute based at New York University in 2019. However, the act of AI washing had been used earlier in various campaigns trying to attract customers with "innovative" products or services.
